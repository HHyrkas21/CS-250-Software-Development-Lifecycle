**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
  Interpreting user needs starts with gathering the requirements needed through things like interviews, surveys, or even direct observation of the users. This can help in understanding what their goals, challenges, and priorities might be, and how they can be changed and added to the program or system. We should also take into consideration to identify the  inputs and outputs. Interpreting user needs is the first step in creating a solution that addresses the requirements.

  Creating user stories can significantly help with this by simplifying complex requirements into more manageable, understandable, and actionable tasks. User stories help in focusing on the users and what their viewpoint is, helping to keep the focus on what the user finds important, as well as prioritization of features based on user value, and proper communication to help ensure that everyone understands the intended functionality.

  
**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
  My approach to developing programs was primarily focused on the principles of Agile methodologies and using Scrum. I prioritized clean code, frequent testing, and modularity, which allowed me to make changes and improvements continuously during development instead of having to wait for a final project. I aim to incorporate Agile processes, like Scrum, in future development work for structured iteration, as well as continuous integration/continuous deployment for more optimized and efficient development cycles.

  
**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
  To be a good team member in software development, we have to look further beyond just writing code. Being a good team member means we have solid communication skills, allowing us to effectively provide feedback, share ideas, and actively listen to the team members, stakeholders, and users during development. Collaboration also plays a key role, since the team, stakeholders, and users are actively working towards a common goal while respecting each other's perspectives and contributions to the discussions and decisions of a project. Taking accountability for not just the successes, but the failures and learnings as well.
